# Final-Assignment
This is a project from Workearly about Data Analysis. 

The project includes: 
- An SQL query to get the results from the database and save them as a CSV file

- Using Python and Pandas to filter some data from the csv and get the most most popular item sold based on zip code and the percentage of sales per store

- Using a Python library to visualize the filtered data (I used Seaborn)
